1- Recon specific:
● Recon
● JS + HTML full code review
● JS Files analysis (Static / dynamic, functionalities, extracting secrets , parameters)
● Map entry points (Access all functionalities/ Increase Access)
● DO initial tests (things to look at first)
● Scanners (Scanning)
● Third party scanning (S3 Buckets, Github)
● Version detection and vulns (website (tech stack, language, versions) + webserver + network)
● Vulnerabilities in all tech stack
● CMS exploitation (Vulns, default creds, misconfigurations , others)

1- Bugs:
●  Fuzzing every user input field too (Fuzzing server wide issues and other input specifics too)
●  Fuzzing and seeing response length and timing and other changes (For all bugs)
● Others easy bugs + Default Creds + Subdomain Takeovers + .git files + S3 buckets + Login brute force
● Sensitive data exposure/ Misconfigurations
● Broken authentication  + Default / weak credentials + Rate limit
● Race condition on all sensitive functions
● Access Control/IDORs (Multi Step Processes , Privilege Escalation - Horizontal / Vertical, Broken Object level -IDOR , Parameter Level , Function Level , Logic Bugs)(Must see seperately for all cases)
● Logic Bugs (Changing Business Logic)
● Rate Limiting bugs (Leading to disruption of logic)
● Sql Injection / No Sql Injection / Ldap Injection (Try for Second Order Injection Too , In pages where data is retrieved, shown , used)
● Cmd Injection
● SSTI / CSTI (Must - Both)
● Second Order Injection (all injections / vulns) ,In pages where data is retrieved, reflected , used
● XSS (Blind + DOM (with DOM invader) + Reflective + Stored + CSTI) (Separately)
● Dom Based Injections (Redirects , Post messages) +  Content injection + Dangling markup injection
● Csrf (State Chaning Requests, can be GET (vulnerable to csrf) / Post/ Others)
● Clickjacking + (Session Fixation for double submit) + Session Fixation
● File Upload 
● LFI / RFI / Directory (Path) Traversal
● Directory traversal if app using internal routes
● SSRF (Open redirect too)
● Open Redirects on Redirects
● XXE / Xml Based Attacks (Other xml injection)
● Origin Ip Finding
● 403,401, 302 Bypasses
● APi Versions + Sensitive Parameters + BOLA + IDORS
● Other Api Bugs
● JWT + Session Attacks (Try Both)
● CRLF Injection
● CORS
● Parameter Pollution (Trying with Post/Get/Json/Xml and Double parameters for stuff like $_REQUEST superglobal)
● S3 / Lambda / Other Aws / Cloud misconfigs
● Others like BLH
● Cache Poisoning + Cache Deception
● Request Smuggling
● Insecure Deserialization
● Unicode Normalization
● Prototype Pollution (Client side + Server Side) (Try Both)
● Web socket vulnerabilities (Try other vulns in sockets data too)
● Bypassing WAF and Filters
● Whitebox Bugs (can test in blackbox too) (Loose Comparison / Type Confusion +  Insecure Desearialization (code execution, login bypass, Object injection))
● Code review + Sast Analysis
● Crypto bugs if custom crypto
● Pwn bugs if using low level languages
